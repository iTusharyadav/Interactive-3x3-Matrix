# Interactive 3x3 Matrix


This project is an interactive web application built with **React**. The application features a **3x3 matrix** of cells that change color when clicked. Each cell turns **green** when clicked, and upon clicking the **last cell** (bottom-right), all previously clicked cells will change to **orange** in the order they were clicked.

The project also includes a **Reset** button to clear the matrix and an **Instruction** button that navigates to a page with usage instructions.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **React Router**: For navigating between the main app and the instruction page.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive layout.
