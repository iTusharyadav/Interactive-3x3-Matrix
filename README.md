Each cell turns **green** when clicked, and upon clicking the **last cell** (bottom-right), all previously clicked cells will change to **orange** in the order they were clicked.

The project also includes a **Reset** button to clear the matrix and an **Instruction** button that navigates to a page with usage instructions.
